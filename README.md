# Message Collapser Extension for SillyTavern

This extension enhances your SillyTavern experience by allowing you to collapse and expand chat messages. It helps manage long conversations, declutter the interface, and focus on the most relevant parts of your chat history.

## Features

*   **Individual Message Toggling**: Click an arrow icon next to any message to collapse or expand its content.
*   **Global Actions**:
    *   **Collapse All**: Collapse all messages in the current chat.
    *   **Expand All**: Expand all previously collapsed messages.
*   **Hidden Message Management**:
    *   **Collapse Hidden**: Specifically collapse messages that have been marked as 'hidden' (soft-deleted, typically indicated by an eye-slash icon).
    *   **Expand Hidden**: Expand all 'hidden' messages.
*   **Master Toggle**: Easily enable or disable the entire extension's functionality via its settings panel.
*   **Visual Indicators**: Clear arrow icons (chevron-down for expanded, chevron-right for collapsed) indicate the state of messages.
